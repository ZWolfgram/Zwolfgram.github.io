Abstract: Odd elastic behavior is investigated in 2d structures with only the odd elastic parameter K^0 under classic continuum theory. For the Kirchhoff–Love plate with a constant K^0, the displacement formulation is independent of the odd parameter, whereas the moment formulation shows dependence. A simply-supported plate under a uniformly distributed load and center point load is investigated using the displacement formulation to determine non-obvious moment fields. A general overview of cylindrical shells with odd elasticity is presented with the approach for the Donnell, Sander, and Flügge models.
